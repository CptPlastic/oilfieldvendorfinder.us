    <h2>Tubing Testers Steaming, Inc. </h2>
    <p>Tubing Testers Steam unit can be used for all oilfield and non-oilfield cleaning jobs. Our steam unit can remove paraffin build up from the inside of all sizes of tubing. In addition the steam truck can clean vessels, tank batteries, rig floors, warehouses, holding tanks, privacy fences, parking lots, and anything else that would need high pressure steam cleaning. With the ability to produce steam at temperatures up to 300 degrees and pressure washing up to 3500 p.s.i., there is no job too big or too small. During freezing temperatures, this steam unit can be used to thaw any type of oilfield equipment that holds or carries liquids. Our steam boiler is inspected annually and certified by the National Board of Boiler & Vessel Inspectors, and the Texas Department of Licensing & Regulation to ensure the upmost safety compliance.</p>
